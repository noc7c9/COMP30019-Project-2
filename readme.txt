The Game:
Each player starts off with an initial set of cores. You can build new cores within your territory. There is a timer and when the timer hits zero, the cores send out units which automatically start moving to the closest opponent core shooting along the way. Destroying an enemy core gives you more build points which allow you to build more cores. Each core costs the player build points.
The aim of the game is to strategically place cores to destroy all enemy cores, before it destroys you!

Controls:
•	Touch the floor (within your territory) to place  core
•	Tilt the device to pan the screen
•	Touch and drag to move the camera

App Certification:
•	A certification report is attached that passes almost all tests.

Lighting and Shading:
•	Floor Shader: A custom shader was implemented that not only made a grid, but also coloured the lines on the grid, surrounding the core, to represent the territory it owned. The intensity of the colour fades as you reach the border of a core’s territory.
•	Unit Shader: Phong Illuminitation was used on the units, with the cores acting as light sources.
•	A particle system is used to emulate explosions when cores and units are destroyed
•	Cores can cast shadows to the floor. As the floor is black, these shadows have been coloured so they show up.
